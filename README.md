An AI-Powered (GPT 3.5 turbo) lore generator. Creates immersive stories in the world of league of legends

## Setting up Environment Variables 

I personally did not upload my .env file onto github for security reasons and to not breach OpenAI policy 

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

OPENAI_API_KEY = your-api-key-here

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual API key.
