## Setting up Environment Variables 

I personally did not upload my .env file onto github for security reaons and to not breach OpenAI policy 

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

OPENAI_API_KEY = your-api-key-here

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual API key.
